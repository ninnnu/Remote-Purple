Remote Purple is a remote controller for Finch and Pidgin (http://pidgin.im). It enables using Pidgin/Finch remotely without
direct graphical/terminal access in a manner similar to Quassel IRC.

== Usage ==
Put rp-server.py and purple_pb2.py to the computer running Pidgin or Finch, run it with "./rp-server.py PASSWORD".
Client-side needs RPClient.py, rp-gtk-client.py and purple_pb2.py. Launch it with "./rp-gtk-client.py SERVER PASSWORD".

== Known bugs ==
There seems to be some issues with keeping client, server and the Pidgin/Finch itself in sync with conversations.

== TODO ==
Support connecting/disconnecting accounts. 
Possibly managing file transfers etc. more advanced features that are available via DBus.
